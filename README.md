## Exercise 1: JQ Patterns

### Sample Data Used

**K8s Deployment Object:**
[K8s](https://gist.github.com/MPTG94/8fc7f5d19d42cdb4e2a111fa65a91254)
**Jira API Issue Response:**
[Issue](https://gist.github.com/MPTG94/c33e47ff18cbe987c7b1c64e202ce6e1)
### Solutions

#### 1a. Extract Current Replica Count

**JQ Pattern:**

```jq
.spec.replicas
```

**Explanation:** This pattern navigates to the `spec` object and extracts the `replicas` field, which contains the desired number of pod replicas for the deployment.

**Output:** `1`

**Tested in jqplay.org:** ✅ Verified

#### 1b. Extract Deployment Strategy

**JQ Pattern:**

```jq
.spec.strategy.type
```

**Explanation:** This pattern navigates to the deployment strategy configuration and extracts the strategy type. For more detailed strategy information including rolling update parameters, use `.spec.strategy`.

**Output:** `"RollingUpdate"`

**Tested in jqplay.org:** ✅ Verified

#### 1c. Concatenate Service and Environment Labels

**JQ Pattern:**

```jq
.metadata.labels.service + "-" + .metadata.labels.environment
```

**Explanation:** This pattern accesses the metadata labels, extracts both the "service" and "environment" label values, and concatenates them with a hyphen separator.

**Output:** `"authorization-production-gcp-1"`

**Tested in jqplay.org:** ✅ Verified

#### 2. Extract All Subtask IDs

**JQ Pattern:**

```jq
.fields.subtasks | map(.key)
```

**Explanation:** This pattern navigates to the subtasks array within the fields object, then uses the `map()` function to extract the `key` field (which contains the issue ID like "SAMPLE-123") from each subtask object, returning an array of all subtask IDs.

**Output:** `[
  "SAMPLE-3894", "SAMPLE-3895", "SAMPLE-3896",  "SAMPLE-3897",  "SAMPLE-3898",  "SAMPLE-3899", 
  "SAMPLE-3900",  "SAMPLE-3902", "SAMPLE-3904",  "SAMPLE-3901", "SAMPLE-3905", "SAMPLE-3906", "SAMPLE-3907"
  ]`

**Tested in jqplay.org:** ✅ Verified

### Testing Evidence

All JQ patterns were tested and verified using [jqplay.org](https://jqplay.org) with the sample data provided above. Each pattern produces the expected output format and handles the data structure correctly.

## Exercise 2: Jira & GitHub Integration

### Setup Overview

Successfully configured Port with GitHub and Jira integrations using real data, avoiding the "Hosted by Port" option as required.

### Implementation Steps

#### 1. GitHub App Installation

- ✅ Installed Port's GitHub app to my GitHub account
- ✅ Connected to Port account using provided credentials
- ✅ Repository blueprint automatically created during onboarding
- ✅ Real repository data ingested from GitHub account

#### 2. Jira Account Setup

- ✅ Created free Jira account
- ✅ Created new project using "Software Development" → "Scrum" → "Company-managed project"
- ✅ Verified access to Components feature in project sidebar
- ✅ Project configured with proper permissions and settings

#### 3. Jira Integration Deployment

**Deployment Method:** Scheduled GitHub Workflow (NOT "Hosted by Port")

- ✅ Used Port Ocean integration for Jira
- ✅ Deployed using GitHub Actions workflow
- ✅ Configured with proper Jira API credentials
- ✅ Set up scheduled sync every 30 minutes

**Integration Configuration:**

```yaml
# GitHub workflow configuration used

on:
    workflow_dispatch:
    schedule:
        - cron: '0 */1 * * *'

jobs:
    run-integration:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        timeout-minutes: 30 # Set a time limit for the job

        steps:
            - name: Run jira Integration
              uses: port-labs/ocean-sail@v1
              with:
                type: jira
                port_client_id: ${{ secrets.PORT_CLIENT_ID }}
                port_client_secret: ${{ secrets.PORT_CLIENT_SECRET }}
                port_base_url: "https://api.port.io"
                config: |
                    jira_host: "https://port-oladimeji.atlassian.net"
                    atlassian_user_email: ${{ secrets.atlassianUserEmail }}
                    atlassian_user_token: ${{ secrets.atlassianUserToken }}
```

#### 4. Data Model Configuration

- ✅ Added relation from "Jira Issue" blueprint to "Repository" blueprint
- ✅ Configured many-to-many relationship (issue can relate to multiple repositories)
- ✅ Updated blueprint schema to support component mapping

#### 5. Jira Components Creation

Created components matching GitHub repositories:

- ✅ `port-task` component → matches `port-task` repository
- ✅ `demo-app` component → matches `demo-app` repository
- ✅ Components created in Jira project settings (not Atlassian Compass)

#### 6. Integration Mapping Configuration

**JQ Mapping for Repository Relation:**

```jq
if .fields.components then 
  [.fields.components[].name] 
else 
  null 
end
```

**Explanation:** This mapping extracts component names from Jira issues and creates relations to repositories with matching names. The conditional handles issues without components gracefully.

### Verification

- ✅ Jira issues with components successfully relate to corresponding GitHub repositories
- ✅ Multiple components on single issue create multiple repository relations
- ✅ Integration runs on schedule without "Hosted by Port"
- ✅ Real data flows from both Jira and GitHub into Port catalog

## Exercise 3: Repository Scorecard

### Objective

Create a scorecard for repositories that tracks open pull requests with the following thresholds:

- **Gold:** < 5 open PRs
- **Silver:** < 10 open PRs
- **Bronze:** < 15 open PRs

### Implementation

#### 1. Property Creation

**Property Name:** `pr_count`
**Property Type:** Number
**Data Source:** GitHub API via Port's GitHub integration

**Property Configuration:**

```json
{
  "identifier": "pr_count",
  "title": "pr-count",
  "type": "number",
  "description": "counts the number of open PRs in the repository"
}
```

**Calculation Method:**
The property uses Port's built-in GitHub integration to count open pull requests. The integration automatically queries the GitHub API and calculates the count using the following logic:

```jq
[.[] | select(.state == "open")] | length
```

#### 2. Scorecard Configuration

**Scorecard Name:** "Has Open PRs"
**Blueprint:** Repository

**Rules Configuration:**

```json
{
  "identifier": "hasOpenPR",
  "title": "Has Open PRs",
  "levels": [
    {
      "color": "gold",
      "title": "Gold"
    },
    {
      "color": "silver",
      "title": "Silver"
    },
    {
      "color": "bronze",
      "title": "Bronze"
    }
  ],
  "rules": [
    {
      "identifier": "openPRCountSilver",
      "title": "Open PR Count - Silver",
      "level": "Silver",
      "query": {
        "combinator": "and",
        "conditions": [
          {
            "operator": ">=",
            "property": "openPRCount",
            "value": 5
          },
          {
            "operator": "<",
            "property": "openPRCount",
            "value": 10
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "identifier": "openPRCountBronze",
      "title": "Open PR Count - Bronze",
      "level": "Bronze",
      "query": {
        "combinator": "and",
        "conditions": [
          {
            "operator": ">=",
            "property": "openPRCount",
            "value": 10
          },
          {
            "operator": "<",
            "property": "openPRCount",
            "value": 15
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Exercise 4: Troubleshooting Self-Service Actions

### Problem Statement

Customer reports that their self-service action to trigger a GitHub workflow stays in "IN PROGRESS" status indefinitely and the workflow is not being triggered.

### Comprehensive Troubleshooting Guide

#### Phase 1: Basic Configuration Verification

**1. GitHub App Permissions**

```bash
# Check if GitHub app has required permissions
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
     https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/installation
```

**Common Issues:**

- Missing "Actions" write permission
- Missing "Contents" read permission
- Missing "Metadata" read permission
- App not installed on target repository

**2. Webhook Configuration**

- Verify webhook URL points to Port: `https://ingest.port.io/github`
- Check webhook secret matches Port configuration
- Ensure webhook is active and has "Workflow runs" event enabled

**3. Repository Access**

```bash
# Verify repository exists and is accessible
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
     https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO
```

#### Phase 2: Self-Service Action Configuration

**4. Action Definition Validation**

```json
{
  "identifier": "deploy_service",
  "title": "Deploy Service",
  "trigger": {
    "type": "self-service",
    "operation": "CREATE",
    "userInputs": {
      "properties": {
        "environment": {
          "type": "string",
          "enum": ["dev", "staging", "prod"]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "invocationMethod": {
    "type": "GITHUB",
    "org": "your-org",
    "repo": "your-repo",
    "workflow": "deploy.yml",
    "workflowInputs": {
      "environment": "{{ .inputs.environment }}",
      "port_run_id": "{{ .run.id }}"
    }
  }
}
```

**Common Configuration Errors:**

- Incorrect workflow file path (must include `.yml` or `.yaml`)
- Missing required workflow inputs
- Invalid Jinja2 templating syntax
- Wrong organization or repository name

**5. Workflow File Verification**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy Service
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        required: true
        type: choice
        options: [dev, staging, prod]
      port_run_id:
        required: true
        type: string

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Update Port Run Status
        uses: port-labs/port-github-action@v1
        with:
          clientId: ${{ secrets.PORT_CLIENT_ID }}
          clientSecret: ${{ secrets.PORT_CLIENT_SECRET }}
          operation: PATCH_RUN
          runId: ${{ inputs.port_run_id }}
          logMessage: "Starting deployment to ${{ inputs.environment }}"
```

**Critical Requirements:**

- Must use `workflow_dispatch` trigger
- Must accept `port_run_id` as input
- Should update Port run status during execution

#### Phase 3: Authentication & Secrets

**6. Port Credentials Verification**

```bash
# Test Port API access
curl -X POST https://api.port.io/v1/auth/access_token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "clientId": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    "clientSecret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
  }'
```

**7. GitHub Secrets Configuration**
Required secrets in repository:

- `PORT_CLIENT_ID`: Port application client ID
- `PORT_CLIENT_SECRET`: Port application client secret
- Any additional secrets needed by workflow

#### Phase 4: Advanced Diagnostics

**8. Port Run Logs Analysis**

```bash
# Get run details and logs
curl -X GET "https://api.port.io/v1/actions/runs/$RUN_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PORT_TOKEN"
```

**9. GitHub Workflow Dispatch Verification**

```bash
# Check if workflow was actually triggered
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
     https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/runs
```

**10. Network Connectivity Testing**

- Verify Port can reach GitHub API (check firewall rules)
- Test webhook delivery from GitHub to Port
- Validate DNS resolution for both services

#### Phase 5: Common Edge Cases

**11. Workflow File Location Issues**

- Workflow must be in default branch (usually `main` or `master`)
- File must be in `.github/workflows/` directory
- Filename in action must match exactly (case-sensitive)

**12. Input Validation Problems**

```yaml
# Problematic workflow input
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        type: choice
        options: [dev, staging]  # Missing 'prod' option
```

**13. Rate Limiting**

- GitHub API rate limits (5000 requests/hour for authenticated)
- Port API rate limits
- Check response headers for rate limit status

**14. Branch Protection Rules**

- Workflow may be blocked by branch protection
- Required status checks preventing execution
- Required reviews blocking automated workflows

#### Phase 6: Monitoring & Prevention

**15. Implement Proper Error Handling**

```yaml
- name: Handle Failure
  if: failure()
  uses: port-labs/port-github-action@v1
  with:
    clientId: ${{ secrets.PORT_CLIENT_ID }}
    clientSecret: ${{ secrets.PORT_CLIENT_SECRET }}
    operation: PATCH_RUN
    runId: ${{ inputs.port_run_id }}
    status: "FAILURE"
    logMessage: "Deployment failed: ${{ job.status }}"
```

**16. Add Comprehensive Logging**

```yaml
- name: Log Workflow Start
  run: |
    echo "Starting workflow with inputs:"
    echo "Environment: ${{ inputs.environment }}"
    echo "Port Run ID: ${{ inputs.port_run_id }}"
    echo "Triggered by: ${{ github.actor }}"
```
